"""ops/rss_probe.py -- stdlib-only (ctypes) Windows RSS reader, for the CURRENT
process or an arbitrary external PID (e.g. a spawned `streamlit run` child).

Written for BUILD_PLAN_2E.md Stream T (RAM fit gate): `psutil` is not installed
in env-app and must not be added to requirements.txt for a test-only need, so
this copies+extends `test_engine_identity.py::peak_rss_gb`'s own ctypes
PROCESS_MEMORY_COUNTERS pattern (same struct) to accept a `pid`, opening the
target process with PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION | PROCESS_VM_READ (0x0400 |
0x0010) -- no admin needed for a process owned by the same user.

Returns MB (not GB, unlike the identity test's own helper) since the ram
budget numbers this stream reports are in the 300-1500 MB range.
