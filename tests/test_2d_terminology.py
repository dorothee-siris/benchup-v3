"""tests/test_2d_terminology.py -- Phase 2D, stream TEV5, cross-cutting
guard for E1 (BUILD_PLAN_2D.md S1/S7): "European baseline" = EU27 + the
selected friend countries (UK, CH, NO, IS), swept across every rendered
string, defined once in Methods; plus E3's suffix-naming ruling (PP10_WD /
FWCI_EU) at its two primary label hooks.

Reuses `tests/test_narrative.py::collect_copy_module_strings` -- the SAME
recursive walk `test_forbidden_vocabulary.py`'s own jargon sweep already
trusts -- rather than re-implementing a second string collector that could
silently drift from the first.

Scope note (deliberately NARROW, to avoid a false positive on live,
correct copy): the OLD phrasings this module bans are the SPECIFIC compound
strings the press audit / VL4 actually found and fixed ("a European
reference", "that European average", in `copy.COLLAB["COL_FWCI_HELP"]",
progress/2D_VL4.md S "E1"), not a blanket ban on the words "European
reference"/"European average" in isolation -- MT4's own NEW, ruled Methods
section is deliberately titled "The European average behind a reference
line" (progress/2D_MT4.md S1), and banning that substring outright would
fail on a correct, reviewed string rather than catch a regression. The
suffix check below is likewise scoped to the two hooks E3 actually names
(`copy.COMPARE["METRIC_PP"/"METRIC_FWCI"]`, `copy.FIND["KPI_PP_LABEL"]`) --
a residual "PP(top10%)" literal survives in a few OTHER Find keys
(`CARD_PP`/`ASP_SORT_LABEL`/`ASP_UNDEFINED`/`COL_PP`/`TILE_PP`), already
disclosed by VC4 as a known, out-of-fence gap for a future round
(progress/2D_VC4.md S12) -- asserting it away here would fail on a KNOWN,
undisputed gap rather than guard the E1/E3 rulings this module owns.

VACUITY, per module: every assertion is followed by an in-memory mutation
that makes the identical check fail.
