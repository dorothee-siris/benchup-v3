"""tests/test_methods_note.py -- Stream N (Phase 2B, 2B-9 / BUILD_PLAN_2B.md
§0 A5).

The Methods page renders `lib/copy.METHODS`, a dict of `{title, body}`
templates whose every number is a `{placeholder}` the page fills at run time.
`docs/METHODS_NOTE.md` is the human-readable source of the same sections,
with the numbers written out and a citation per claim, and is never rendered
by the app. Nothing keeps the two in step except this file:

  1. every `METHODS` section has a `## ` heading in the .md carrying its
     exact title, so a section cannot be added to the page without its
     source text;
  2. every `{placeholder}` appearing in a `METHODS` body or title is
     documented in `copy.METHODS_SOURCES`, so no number can reach the page
     without a named source (CFG key, manifest key, index column);
  3. `METHODS_SOURCES` carries no dead entries, so the mapping stays a
     contract rather than a wish list.

The digit-ban is NOT relaxed anywhere here: `METHODS_SOURCES` describes each
source in words ("CFG bonus_year", "count of distinct panel_idx in
erc.parquet") and is scanned by `tests/test_narrative.py` like every other
uppercase constant in `lib/copy.py`.
