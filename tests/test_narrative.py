"""
tests/test_narrative.py -- Stream G: the digit-ban regression (BUILD_PLAN_2A.md
L10 / Stream F build step 5 / Stream G build step 2).

RULE: no digit character appears in a Find-page user-facing string except
inside an allowlisted token (tests/digit_allowlist.txt) or a `{placeholder}`
a caller fills at render time from CFG or the live data. Two scopes:

  (a) every string constant in lib/copy.py (dict values included), which
      since Stream X1 (2026-08-29) also carries the Find-page strings
      formerly in lib/views_find.py's EXTRA_COPY dict, folded into
      lib/copy.py's own `FIND` dict -- one collector, no separate
      views_find.py import needed for this scope any more.

  (b) string literals passed to a Streamlit UI call, or to that call's
      label=/help=/caption=/placeholder= kwarg, in pages/*.py, Menu.py,
      lib/views_*.py (glob -- Phase 2B added lib/views_compare.py,
      lib/views_collab.py, lib/views_methods.py alongside lib/views_find.py;
      a future views_*.py needs no edit here), lib/ranked.py, lib/filters.py,
      lib/badges.py, lib/selection.py, lib/exports_xlsx.py,
      lib/charts_compare.py, lib/tiles.py, lib/wordcloud_png.py.

      WIDENED FOR PHASE 2B (BUILD_PLAN_2B.md S0 A5, Stream G): rev 0 of this
      file scanned a five-file literal list + pages/*.py -- nothing Phase 2B
      created (the Compare/Collaborate pages and their six new lib modules)
      was covered. `SCOPE_B_FILES` below now globs lib/views_*.py rather than
      naming lib/views_find.py alone, and explicitly adds the other five new
      modules the brief names. Two of them (lib/charts_compare.py,
      lib/exports_xlsx.py) hold no `import streamlit` at all -- they are
      scanned anyway (the AST walk costs nothing on a file with zero matches)
      so a future UI call added to either is covered from day one, not
      discovered by a second widening.

      DEVIATION FROM THE LITERAL BRIEF WORDING ("ast walk: Call nodes whose
      func is st.<name> or st.column_config.<name>"): lib/views_find.py
      aliases st.sidebar to `sb`, st.columns(...) to `cols`, individual
      columns to `col_a`/`col_b`/`cols[0]`, etc. (this is ordinary Streamlit
      style, not an obfuscation) -- a matcher that only recognises a literal
      `st.xxx` / `st.column_config.xxx` attribute chain would silently miss
      almost every real call in that file (sb.header, sb.selectbox,
      cols[0].metric, col_a.write, ...), making the test vacuous for the
      file with the most UI copy. Instead a Call is treated as an in-scope
      UI call when its final attribute name is a real, callable member of
      the INSTALLED `streamlit` module or `streamlit.column_config` (built
      from `dir(st)` / `dir(st.column_config)` at test-collection time) --
      grounded in the actual Streamlit API surface, alias-proof, and needs
      no maintenance as new aliases or files appear (test_palette.py uses
      the same "scan whatever exists" philosophy for its own directory
      walk).

EXCLUDED (scope fence, one reason each -- BUILD_PLAN_2A.md Stream G):
  lib/palette.py     -- hex colour constants only, no UI copy.
  lib/data_cache.py  -- parquet/JSON column names and file paths, not UI copy.
  lib/app_config.py  -- loads config.yaml verbatim into CFG, defines no strings.
  lib/exports.py     -- CSV filename template, not rendered UI copy.
  lib/engine/**      -- no Streamlit import anywhere in the engine package.
  lib/compare_data.py, lib/collab_data.py, lib/profile_data.py, lib/links.py,
  lib/search.py, lib/countries.py -- Phase 2B additions, checked at
  test-collection time (test_pure_data_modules_hold_no_ui_copy below): none
  imports streamlit, so none can define a `st.*` UI call for the AST walk to
  find, and none is an uppercase copy.py-style constant module either --
  excluded on the same "no UI copy possible" ground as the five files above,
  not by omission.
  lib/state.py -- DOES import streamlit (checked, deliberately not in the
  list above), but only ever calls `st.session_state`'s dict-like methods
  (`setdefault`/`.remove`/`.clear`/subscript) -- `session_state` is not a
  callable member of `dir(st)`, so its own attribute accesses never match
  ST_CALL_NAMES, and `.setdefault`/`.remove`/`.clear` are dict methods, not
  Streamlit ones. test_pure_data_modules_hold_no_ui_copy checks the weaker,
  correct claim for this file: zero calls whose function name is itself a
  `dir(st)` member.

NON-VACUITY PROOF: run standalone (not part of this suite -- see
V3/progress/2A_G.md for the transcript):

A5 WIDENING NON-VACUITY PROOF (Stream G, 2026-08-29 -- see progress/2B_G.md

already covered; the point of A5 is that scope (b) now reaches the SIX
Phase 2B files rev 0 never touched. Proof on one of them
