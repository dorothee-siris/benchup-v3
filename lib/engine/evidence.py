app/lib/engine/evidence.py -- lens-specific evidence (BUILD_PLAN_2A.md S9,
Refinement R1, Stream R-B, decision L21): "the top shared cell" for a
seed/candidate pair under one lens, i.e. the single field/subfield/topic/ERC
panel/SDG that contributes most to that lens's overlap score, replacing the
lens-blind "Top field" evidence line every table showed before R1.

Formula (per lens, mirroring `lenses.rank_all`'s own branch exactly):
  cell        = argmax_j min(seed_j, cand_j) over the lens's substrate row pair
  contribution = min(seed_j, cand_j) / denom, where denom is the SAME quantity
                 the lens's own score formula divides by:
                   - the eight plain histogram-intersection lenses (L0, L1,
                     L3, L4, L6, L2f, L5, L7): denom = Sigma_j min(seed_j,
                     cand_j) -- which IS that lens's score (`rank_all`/
                     `lens_lib.histogram_intersection_row` return exactly this
                     sum, no further division), so `score` below equals
                     `rank_all`'s own number and contributions sum to 1.
                   - C1: denom = the seed's own top-20-subfield mass
                     (`build_c1_for_seed`'s `denom`), NOT Sigma_j min --
                     mirroring the engine's numerator/denom split (the plan's
                     own instruction for this lens).
                   - F1: same reasoning extended to F1's own numerator/denom
                     split (`rank_all`'s F1 branch divides by the seed's total
                     frontier share, not by Sigma_j min) -- not named
                     explicitly in the plan's C1 sentence, but the identical
                     shape of the formula, so mirrored the same way rather
                     than left inconsistent (documented in progress/R1_B.md
                     as an interpretation, not a literal instruction).
                 Bounded by construction: min_j <= seed_j always, and denom is
                 either Sigma_j min_j (>= any one term) or a seed-only mass
                 that is itself the sum of the seed_j values the min_j terms
                 are drawn from -- so 0 < contribution <= 1 whenever the cell
                 exists.

Namespaces: L0 -> field name, L1/C1/L2f -> subfield name, L3/F1 -> topic name
(topics_dim.parquet, loaded lazily and cached on ctx -- that table is NOT the
five-column topics_all slice `load_context` already holds), L4/L5 -> ERC panel
label (resources/erc_panels.csv), L6/L7 -> SDG label (resources/sdg_labels.csv).

Deviation from the plan's literal signature: `top_shared_cell` takes `ctx` as
its first argument (plan text: `top_shared_cell(subs, lens, seed_idx,
cand_idx)`) because labelling needs `ctx`'s name maps / lazily-cached topic
and resource lookups, which `subs` does not carry. `rows_evidence`'s
signature is unchanged (it already takes `ctx`, the plan's own S9.4 contract).
