"""
R2 S2 (REFINEMENT_PLAN.md S10.2, S2 row; R2.19/R2.20) -- the app's future data
layer: given the one topic-grain master (`topics_all` + `topics_dim`), derive
`subfields`/`fields` shapes for ANY tree x basis x 811-toggle scenario with
duckdb (in-process, $0, MIT), instead of shipping all 12 scenarios
precomputed. This module is copied verbatim into the Sprint-2 app.

`derive_shapes(topics_all_path, topics_dim_path, tree, basis, exclude_811,
index_institution_ids=None)` reproduces `pipeline/agg/trees_agg.py`'s
`build_subfields`/`build_fields` EXACTLY for basis='frac' (the only basis
trees_agg ever computes -- see "basis generalization" note below), on the
topic grain instead of the raw corpus grain: under `assignment='primary'`
(the shipped default, R2.18) a work's full weight lands on its primary topic
only, and trees_agg maps that SAME primary topic to a subfield -- so
GROUP BY (institution, tree_subfield(topic)) over `topics_all` and GROUP BY
(institution, tree_subfield(primary_topic)) over the raw corpus are the same
sum, just computed from a pre-aggregated intermediate table instead of every
work row.

Nesting is identical to trees_agg: subfield -> field is fixed (never
re-derived per tree, R4's own rule), shares sum to 1 per institution PER
SCENARIO (the denominator is the scenario's own total, i.e. excluded-topic
mass is dropped from BOTH numerator and denominator when exclude_811=True --
R2.20's "excluded removes topics from shapes/SI/L3 ONLY"), and SI is
NaN below the G6 floor.

BASIS GENERALIZATION (a documented judgment call, not lifted from trees_agg --
trees_agg has no `basis` toggle at all, it only ever computes ONE `si` column
from share_frac): when basis='full', `si` is computed from share_full ÷
mean(share_full) instead. The G6 FLOOR TEST STAYS ON vol_frac REGARDLESS of
`basis` -- REFINEMENT_PLAN.md's own registry entry (2026-08-27 07:40,
"Method B -> continuous fallback") states the ratified floor is a floor on
FRACTIONAL MASS ("vol_frac >= 30 ~ 100 full works"), not on whichever basis
happens to be displayed; trees_agg's own code hard-codes the vol_frac test
unconditionally, which is consistent with reading the floor as basis-
independent. This basis='full' path is NOT covered by the Tier-A identity
check against the shipped tables (trees_agg never ships a full-basis si to
compare against) -- flagged here and in the S2 report, not silently assumed.

MEAN-SHARE POPULATION (the second documented nuance, found reading trees_agg
line by line, not assumed from the plan's prose): "mean share across index
institutions" is NOT a mean over every institution in the index -- it is a
mean over every institution that has a NONZERO row for that subfield under
that tree (trees_agg's `overall.groupby("subfield_id")["share_frac"].mean()`
runs on the already topic-mapped, already-filtered `overall` frame, which
only has a row where an institution's mass in that subfield is > 0).
`derive_shapes` reproduces this exactly: the mean is computed from
`subfields_raw` (already exclude_811-filtered and index_institution_ids-
filtered), which by construction only has rows for institutions with
nonzero mass in that (tree, subfield) cell in the given scenario.

BY-YEAR FORMAT DEVIATION (documented, not silently different): the shipped
`subfields.parquet` packs by-year volumes as pipe-strings
('YEAR:value|YEAR:value|...', `trees_agg._pack_year_columns`). `derive_shapes`
instead emits WIDE columns (`vol_full_<year>`/`vol_frac_<year>`, matching
`topics_all`'s own new per-year schema, R2 S2 item 1) whenever the source
`topics_all` parquet HAS those columns (detected live from its schema, not
assumed) -- a duckdb SUM per year is the natural, SQL-native shape for this
data layer and is what the app will actually plot (a trajectory needs
numeric columns, not a string to re-parse); when the source lacks them (the
CURRENT build, pre-S3), the output simply omits them, no fake NaNs.
`fields_df` never carries by-year columns, matching the shipped
`fields.parquet` exactly (trees_agg's `build_fields` has no by-year columns
at all -- field-level trajectories are not part of today's shipped schema).

Ponytail: no classes, no config object -- two small SQL strings (one per
output table) with duckdb's `?`/registered-table parameter binding, no
per-row pandas loops.
