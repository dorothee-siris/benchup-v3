"""
R4 — tree-dependent `fields` (26) / `subfields` (252) tables (REFINEMENT_PLAN.md
S1 R4 row, S7/S8/S9; METHODS_FAISCEAU.md S6). One row per (institution, field-or-
subfield, tree), tree in {original, conservative, bestfit} (pipeline/agg/
taxonomy_trees.py, read-only import). A work's per-tree subfield is looked up
from its (ORIGINAL-tree, D6-basis) `primary_topic_id` via that tree's own
topic->subfield map -- so re-tree-ing only changes which BUCKET a work's mass
lands in, never which works exist or how much mass they carry (institution
totals are IDENTICAL across trees by construction; only the subfield/field
split changes).

subfield->field membership is tree-INDEPENDENT (the repair only reassigns which
of the 252 subfields a topic maps to; it never moves a subfield to a different
field) -- derived once from `topics_dim`'s own (subfield_id, field_id, ...)
columns and asserted 1:1 here, not re-derived per tree.

Shares include EVERY topic's mass (811 excluded topics count in shape, R2.12) --
by construction here, since inclusion is at the WORK level (a work's primary
topic always resolves to a subfield under every tree, `is_excluded` never
removes it from this table; exclusion only ever touches frontier denominators,
computed elsewhere).
ENGINE PORT (Sprint 2 Phase 2A, Stream B): only the docstring, `TREES`,
`G6_FLOOR` and `subfield_to_field_map` are vendored -- the corpus-grain
builders (`build_subfields`/`build_fields`, `topic_to_subfield_maps`,
`_pack_year_columns`) stay in the pipeline; the app derives shapes from the
topic-grain master via `derive.derive_shapes` instead.
