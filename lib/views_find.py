app/lib/views_find.py -- render functions for the Find page (Sprint 2 Phase 2A,
Stream E; rebuilt for Refinement R1 by stream R-E2 against BUILD_PLAN_2A.md
S9.2 L16-L23 and docs/VIZ_SPEC.md S1.3/S1.9/S2.10-S2.22).

COMPOSITION ONLY: every ranking, filter, badge, frame, figure, table shape,
string and number comes from lib/engine and lib/{profile_data,charts,tiles,
wordcloud_png,ranked,search,filters,badges,exports,links,countries,copy,state,
palette,app_config,data_cache}. Nothing here re-implements them and nothing
here types a value into a rendered string (BUILD_PLAN_2A.md L10).

PAGE ORDER (L16/L17, re-laid by R2/L30, re-laid again by Phase 2B-R decision
2B-R-2 as a 2 + 2 split, and again by Phase 2B-R3 Stream SEL, plan §3 SEL,
which compacts the header and moves the search itself off this page entirely;
top to bottom, and the order the code below follows):
  title + one-line promise (`_header`) -> the "Filtered by..." strip slot
  right under it -> ONE dropdown OVER THE BASKET (`_seed_pick`; 2BR3: the
  free-text seed search is GONE from this page -- an institution reaches the
  basket only through the shared sidebar, `lib/selection.render_sidebar`,
  which every page now carries; a basket of exactly one auto-selects itself,
  more than one still needs an explicit pick, which is the SAME "never load a
  match silently" guarantee 2B-R-12 built, now read off the basket instead of
  off a live search) -> PROFILE section: row 1 in two halves (2B-R2-6: SIX KPI
  cards in a 2 x 3 grid, name first and all methodology in a `?` | the identity
  block with the subfield wordcloud under it, the institution NAME itself
  linking to its publications in OpenAlex and a corrected type rendered inline
  with a red star), row 2
  full width (a titled section, one segmented control and one chip legend above
  a height-matched global + yearly breakdown pair whose bonus year is starred
  on the axis), then six collapsed chart panels -> BENCHMARK section, headed by
  the controls row (depth, C1, L7, a post-filters expander) and the "How to
  read the lenses" guide -> the lens tabs, labelled by the bare
  `copy.LENS_DISPLAY_CODE` (2B-R-11a: L0..L9, renumbered in tab order; the
  full `copy.LENS_DISPLAY_NAMES` sentence moved inside each tab body). The
  SIDEBAR holds counting & taxonomy (tree, basis, this page's own scenario
  controls) plus the shared search + basket every page now carries
  (`selection.render_sidebar`, 2BR3 SEL) -- L16 / gate-2A feedback #1's "a
  control that governs one section belongs at the head of that section" is
  why scenario stays here rather than in the Benchmark controls row, and why
  the basket -- app-wide, not Find-specific -- is a shared component instead
  of this page's own.

  Meta text (2BR3 SEL, plan §3): the verdict line and the data-from caption
  that used to sit under the title move to the FOOT of the page
  (`_footer_meta`), after every section -- the promise a reader needs before
  scrolling is one line; the provenance a reader needs is not urgent enough
  to spend that line.

  The R1 coverage line is GONE (L30, VIZ_SPEC S2.12 RETIRED): each of its four
  items now sits where it is read -- ERC-classified share in the ERC panel
  caption, catch-all share in the top-topics caption, L2f-eligible cells in the
  L2f tab's own intro, SDG-tagged share was already a tile.

PERFORMANCE SHAPE (measured on this data, env-app; see progress/R1_E2.md):
  * load_context 2.5 s / build_substrates 4.6 s, both @st.cache_resource;
    rank_all 0.12 s per seed, recomputed every rerun (cheap);
  * build_rows over a FULL ranking is 0.95 s per lens, so rows are built only
    for what is actually shown -- the post-filtered depth cut, the tail-search
    matches, and (lazily, through st.download_button's callable `data`) the
    full filtered ranking for the CSV. The lens-specific evidence
    (`engine.evidence.rows_evidence`) is computed on exactly the same id
    subsets, never on the whole population.
  * `st.expander` BODIES EXECUTE on every rerun even when collapsed -- only
    the display folds. Two consequences, both load-bearing:
      - the POST-FILTERS expander must keep executing (its widgets have to
        register every run), so it is never gated;
      - the six PANEL expanders therefore build six figures every rerun.
        Their FRAMES are `@st.cache_data` keyed on (iid, tree, basis) and
        fetch ctx/subs from the cache_resource internally -- ctx and subs are
        unhashable and are never passed as cache_data arguments -- which is
        what brings a full warm rerun WITH all six panels to a measured
        0.88 s (0.30 s for the profile without them). Gating the bodies on
        the expander's own session-state key was tried and rejected: that
        state resets to the coded `expanded=` on the next rerun
        (progress/R1_E2.md), so a gated panel would blank itself.

STRINGS: every user-facing string lives in `lib/copy.py` under its own
digit-ban rule -- no digit outside a lens code / "top10"; every number is a
`{placeholder}` filled here from CFG or the live data
(`tests/test_narrative.py` enforces this over this file's `st.*` calls).

    co-publications. The last two are PROMOTED here from the identity column
    (2B-R-7 put them there as "facts about the institution"; the gate read them
    as measures, and they have an index median like any other measure, so they
    are now measured against it).

    The publications card is the one card with no index line: its small line
    carries the SAME measure on the fractional basis instead (2B-R2-6), which
    is a companion figure rather than a second card. `_profile_cards` reads
    `KPI_PUBS_KEY` to tell the two forms apart, so the special case is named
    once and never inferred from a position in this list.

    What is GONE and why (2B-R-2, closing R2 gate items #3 and #5):
      * concentration (HHI) and breadth -- R2 had already stripped the
        concentration tile's class word because `hhi_class` called 86 % of the
        index "generalist"; the gate found the bare index equally unreadable,
        and breadth is the same statistic seen from the other side. Both are
        still in `index.parquet` and still exported;
      * the two size tiles, MERGED here: full and fractional counting are one
        measure under two conventions, and reading them as two neighbouring
        "sizes" invited exactly the subtraction they do not support;
      * the bonus-year tile -- a single year's volume next to a five-year
        window is a category error at the same visual weight; the bonus year is
        now marked where it is actually read, on the breakdown's year axis.

    Every definition that used to print as a subline under its tile is in the
    card's `?` tooltip: the card surface carries the name, the value and the
    index position, and nothing else. The publications card's tooltip also
    absorbed the corpus definition that used to hang off the retired "What
    counts as a publication" link (2B-R2-6) -- it is read where the figure it
    qualifies is, not a column away.

    The PP card lost its bootstrap-interval companion line (2B-R2-6): an
    interval printed under a value on a card competed with the value at the
    same visual weight for a caveat that only ever changes a reading at the
    margin. The caveat itself is not dropped -- it is the last sentence of the
    card's own tooltip.

    `frontier_top25_share_index` (not `frontier_top25_share`) is the card's
    value: `seed_card` names the index-basis column that way, while the
    baseline key stays the `index.parquet` column name `baselines.KPI_COLUMNS`
