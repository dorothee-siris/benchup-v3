"""
app/lib/badges.py -- umbrella/aggregate, type-corrected and catch-all badges
(Sprint 2 Phase 2A, Stream F). Pure functions over the institution index /
engine row dicts -- no Streamlit import.

The umbrella rule reads the PATCHED `type` column (config.yaml
umbrella_badge.basis_column), never `type_openalex`, specifically because the
`type_openalex` basis would flag Sciences Po, CentraleSupelec and EHESS -- all
three type-corrected TO education -- as umbrellas at the same time their own
correction says "this is really education".

2B-R2-1a RETIRES the 2A L7 "umbrella and type-corrected are mutually exclusive"
invariant, and with it the assertion that enforced it. The invariant held while
the two flags were drawn from disjoint populations; the 2B-R / R2 type overrides
made ten institutions (Ifremer, TNO, CNR, SINTEF, DLR, Ikerbasque, DZHK, DZNE,
DZL, DZIF) legitimately BOTH -- an umbrella by volume against its country-type
median AND corrected away from the type OpenAlex records. Every one of them
crashed the profile on an AssertionError. The fix is not to suppress one flag
(that hides true information): the type correction is no longer a BADGE at all.
It renders INLINE in the identity line -- "government* (was: facility)" --
built by `corrected_from` below and composed in `lib/views_find.py`; the
umbrella badge is the only badge this module still emits.
