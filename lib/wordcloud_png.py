app/lib/wordcloud_png.py -- the subfield wordcloud as PNG BYTES
(BUILD_PLAN_2A.md S9.2 L17 block 4, VIZ_SPEC.md S2.13).

Copied in from Lorraine Phase 2 `Streamlit/pages/2_(factory)_Laboratoires.py::
render_lab_wordcloud_png` (lines 505-537), including the two things that
implementation exists to fix:

  * it returns PNG **bytes**, never a resident matplotlib figure -- the
    pass-5 leak Lorraine's own docstring records was one figure pinned per
    render for the whole session, because `plt.close()` was never called.
    `WordCloud.to_array()` -> `PIL.Image` -> `io.BytesIO` touches no pyplot
    state at all, so there is nothing to leak;
  * it is `@st.cache_data`, keyed by every rendering parameter, so a rerun
    that changes nothing re-renders nothing (the cloud is the single most
    expensive object in the profile section).

ENCODING (stated in the caller's caption, VIZ_SPEC S2.13): word SIZE is the
subfield's works on the CURRENT counting basis; word COLOUR is its OpenAlex
domain, through `palette.domain_color` -- so the cloud re-tints itself when
the tree changes (a tree decides a subfield's field and therefore its domain)
and re-weights itself when the basis changes. No hex literal appears here:
even the background is `palette.SURFACE`, the same white every figure paints
(`tests/test_palette.py` walks `lib/`).

`wordcloud==1.9.6` (pinned in requirements.txt, wheel + render verified on
this env-app / Python 3.12) is the one new runtime dependency R1 adds; PIL
arrives transitively with it. Both are imported INSIDE the function, Lorraine's
own pattern, so an environment without them degrades to `None` -- the caller
renders the empty-state line -- instead of failing the whole page at import.
