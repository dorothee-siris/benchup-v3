"""BenchUp v3 -- pure Plotly figure builders for the profile section.

NO Streamlit import lives in this module (the same rule the engine package
follows): every function takes a plain DataFrame or plain sequences and returns
a `plotly.graph_objects.Figure`, so it can be unit-tested headless and reused
outside the app. `lib/views_find.py` is the only place that puts a figure on a
page.

Two hard house rules this module is written to satisfy, and the mechanics that
make them true rather than aspirational:

1.  **No colour literal.** Every hue comes from `lib.palette`; `tests/test_palette.py`
    fails the build on a `#RRGGBB` anywhere under `lib/` except `palette.py`.
    That includes the chart surface (`palette.SURFACE`), the gridlines
    (`palette.GRID`), the annotation ink (`palette.INK_SECONDARY`) and the
    hairlines (`palette.BORDER`).

2.  **No digit in any string.** `tests/test_charts.py` scans this file's source
    for a digit inside a string literal, using the SAME allowlist as the
    narrative digit-ban (`tests/digit_allowlist.txt`, read-only -- the allowlist
    is full at its cap and this module adds nothing to it). Consequences that
    are easy to undo by accident:
      * number formats are COMPOSED from int constants
        (`f".{SHARE_DECIMALS}%"`), never typed as `".1%"`;
      * hover text is PRE-FORMATTED in Python and passed through `customdata`
        with `hovertemplate="%{customdata}<extra></extra>"` (Lorraine's idiom),
        so no `%{x:.1%}` and no `%{customdata[0]}` -- both of which carry a
        digit -- ever appears in this file;
      * the SI reference is a LINE at the neutral value, never a text label
        naming that value; the caller writes any such sentence into `copy.py`
        with a `{placeholder}`.
    Anything parametric (counts, thresholds, the year window) is a caller-filled
    `{placeholder}` in a title/caption string the caller owns -- this module
    only accepts already-composed text. `wrap_label`'s `width` is an INT
    constant (`WRAP_WIDTH`), never a string -- the digit-ban only reaches into
    string literals, and an int default argument is not one.

Grammar decided by the R1 A/Bs on real data (`design-system/ab/AB_VERDICT.md`):
  * A/B #3 -> the share + SI pair is TWO ALIGNED PANELS of one figure sharing a
    y-axis: share bars on the left, SI as a lollipop from a dashed reference at
    the neutral value on the right. The rejected rival encoded SI as a tick on
    the share row itself, which put SI on a per-row scale (not comparable
    across rows) and stretched the share axis to fit the tick, degrading the
    primary measure.
  * A/B #4 -> volume sits in a LEFT TEXT GUTTER, right-aligned against the
    zero baseline, not as a right-of-bar annotation. The rival clipped at the
    narrow width and scattered the numbers across the full plot width.
  * Both from Lorraine Phase 2 / BenchUp V1+V2 lineage; the grouped-bar
    geometry below is Lorraine's `_series_offset_width` verbatim, because
    `offsetgroup` is BROKEN on the pinned plotly 5.24.1.

Refinement R2 (BUILD_PLAN_2A.md L34, L35, user ruling items 9/10 at gate 2A)
changed two things about the paired share + SI form above, both still inside
the A/B #3/#4 winning geometry -- neither reopens either A/B:
  * L35 -- **full names, never an ellipsis.** A category label longer than
    `WRAP_WIDTH` now WRAPS onto at most two lines at a word boundary
    (`wrap_label`) instead of being cut short from the right. The row's own
    height grows to fit a two-line label (`row_height`'s `n_wrapped` term).
    This REVERSES the R1 fix-X3 truncation rule below what used to be
    `MAX_LABEL_CHARS`/`_truncate_label`/`ELLIPSIS` -- all three are retired,
    not kept as dead code, since a user ruling that overturns a fix is a
    change the next reader must not think was missed.
  * L34 -- **`si_status` (solid / thin / none) drives the SI mark**, when the
    caller's frame carries that column: a `solid` row keeps the FILLED dot
    this section already used; a `thin` row draws a HOLLOW dot (white fill,
    coloured outline) instead of no mark at all, so a below-the-old-floor cell
    is disclosed rather than erased; a `none` row gets no mark and no stem,
    same as the pre-existing NaN rule. **A zero-volume row never gets a mark,
    whatever `si_status` says** -- the fix for the ERC display bug the user
    saw (a specialisation dot floating at a fabricated value for a panel with
    no publications at all). When the column is absent, the pre-R2 rule
    applies unchanged: a defined `si` gets a filled dot, a NaN `si` gets none.

Refinement 2B-R-13 (BUILD_PLAN_2BR.md, gate-2B-R) changes four more things,
all scoped to the FIND panels this module builds for (`views_find.py`'s
collapsed fields/subfields/topics/frontier/SDG/ERC panels), none of them
touching the Compare-page geometry `lib/charts_compare.py` borrows this
module's private helpers for:

  * **No more wrapping -- widen the gutter instead.** L35 (above) replaced
    truncation with a two-line wrap; 2B-R-13 REVERSES that for the Find
    panels in turn: "full label on one row wins over bar length" is now the
    stated priority, small bars being an acceptable cost. `fig_share_si` and
    `fig_topics` gain a `wrap: bool = False` keyword (default OFF -- the new
    behaviour needs no caller change) that reaches `_tick_display` through
    its own new `wrap` keyword (default `True`, UNCHANGED for any call that
    doesn't pass it). That default matters: `lib/charts_compare.py` calls
    `_tick_display`, `wrap_label`, `row_height`'s `n_wrapped`, `WRAP_WIDTH`
    and `WRAP_ROW_FACTOR` directly, for the Compare page's own geometry,
    which 2B-R-13 does not touch -- so none of that machinery is retired,
    only defaulted OFF for this module's own two Find builders. With
    `wrap=False` a label is never split with `<br>`, `_gutter_margin_px`
    measures the full single-line string (its "longest LINE" is now the
    whole label), and `row_height`'s `n_wrapped` count is always zero, which
    is also most of why this refinement compresses panel height: the old
    "every row pays the two-line pitch the moment ONE row wraps" penalty
    (`row_height`'s note above) never fires once wrapping itself never fires.
  * **The SI unit grid is retired for an outer-end value label.** The old
    per-integer vertical gridline set was a second thing to cross-reference
    against the dashed neutral line; now each row's own SI marker carries its
    OWN formatted value as text, anchored on the side AWAY from the neutral
    reference (`SI_NEUTRAL`) -- left of the dot for a sub-neutral value,
    right for an above-neutral one -- so the reading is local to the row, not
    a lookup against an axis. The dashed neutral reference line itself is
    NOT a "unit gridline" and is kept; only `showgrid` on the SI axis goes to
    `False`.
  * **The frontier quadrant lines are bold ink, not hairline grid.** Same
    `FRONTIER_ORIGIN` split, drawn in `palette.INK` at `FRONTIER_ORIGIN_PX`
    instead of `palette.GRID` at a hairline, so the quadrant read is
    immediate rather than something the eye has to find.
  * **`fig_frontier` takes an optional `top_n`.** The SAME keyword serves
    BOTH of `views_find.py`'s modes (top-N-by-volume and the global
    top-quartile set) -- the builder itself keeps only the `top_n`
    highest-mass rows of whatever frame it receives (`_frontier_topn`,
    ties broken by stable sort so a re-render of the same frame never
    reorders), so the axes autorange to exactly what is drawn either way.
    `None` (the default) reproduces the pre-2B-R-13 behaviour: every row the
    caller already filtered is plotted, uncapped. `frontier_coverage` runs
    the IDENTICAL selection to hand the caller the disclosure numbers a
    caption needs (rows dropped, their mass share, the minimum mass that
    made the cut, how many catch-all rows are among the shown set) as plain
    numbers -- never a string, per this module's digit-ban above -- so chart
    and caption can never drift apart. `fig_topics`'s sort-order toggle is
    also retired here: the `sort` keyword stays (nothing calling it errors)
    but the panel is now ALWAYS volume-ordered, since "top N" is itself a
    volume-defined cut and a taxonomy re-sort of it reads as arbitrary order.

# --- Fix X3 (Refinement R1, inspection finding I-4) ------------------------
# The volume gutter used to be a SEPARATE `add_annotation` sitting in a
# negative-x sliver reserved left of the zero baseline (`GUTTER_FRACTION`/
# `GUTTER_INSET`, retired by this fix), drawn independently of the y-axis
# category label. At a narrow plot width the two
# text elements are laid out by two different systems with no shared
# knowledge of each other's extent, so they can (and at 390 px, did) end up
# with zero space between them, reading as one garbled word.
#
# Measured on plotly 5.24.1 (see `progress/R1_X3.md`): `yaxis.automargin`
# does NOT reserve room away from the plot's own bars for a long tick label --
# it only stops a label being clipped by the OUTER edge of the figure. A
# label longer than the current margin simply draws on top of the plot area
# instead. So automargin alone cannot be the fix; it stays on as a backstop
# for a container narrower than our own estimate, below.
#
# The fix (STILL the mechanism -- only the treatment of an over-length label
# changed, see the R2 note below): fold the volume INTO the y tick text as one
# right-anchored string (`_tick_display`) -- there is then only ONE text
# element per row, so there is nothing left for it to collide with -- and
# reserve the left margin ourselves from the longest resulting LINE
# (`_gutter_margin_px`) rather than assume automargin will do it.
#
# --- R2 (BUILD_PLAN_2A.md L35, user ruling item 10) -------------------------
# X3 originally ellipsised a label past `MAX_LABEL_CHARS` from the right
# (`_truncate_label`). The user reversed that at gate 2A: no chart may ever
# shorten a name, so `MAX_LABEL_CHARS`/`_truncate_label`/`ELLIPSIS` are GONE
# (not left as dead code -- a reversed ruling is worth being explicit about).
# `wrap_label` replaces truncation: a label over `WRAP_WIDTH` chars wraps onto
# at most two lines at a word boundary instead of losing any text, and the row
# grows taller to fit (`row_height`'s `n_wrapped` term, `WRAP_ROW_FACTOR`).
# `_gutter_margin_px` now measures the longest LINE of a (possibly two-line)
# tick string, not the longest whole string, since a wrapped label's second
# line usually holds the trailing words plus the folded-in volume.

    LEFT   horizontal share bars, coloured by `family`; with `gutter=True` the
           volume prints right-aligned in a fixed gutter left of the zero
           baseline, so every number sits in one column (A/B #4).
    RIGHT  the SI lollipop: a stem from the neutral reference to the value and
           a dot at the value, on ONE scale shared by every row, with a dashed
           vertical reference line AND unit grid lines at every integer up to
           the axis max (L34). Mark style is driven by the frame's OWN
           `si_status` column when present -- `solid` -> a FILLED dot (this
           panel's original mark); `thin` -> a HOLLOW dot (white fill, coloured
           outline), disclosing a below-the-old-floor cell instead of erasing
           it; `none` -> no mark and no stem, same treatment as a NaN `si_col`.
           **A zero-volume row NEVER gets a mark, whatever `si_status` says**
           (the ERC display-bug fix, L34/L9): a panel with no publications
           cannot have a specialisation reading. When `si_status` is absent,
           the pre-R2 rule applies unchanged -- a defined `si` gets a filled
           dot, a NaN `si` gets none -- and its hover says so with
           `palette.NA_MARK`.

    `stacked=True` puts the SI panel BELOW the share panel instead of beside it,
    same row order, for the narrow breakpoint: side by side at 390 px each panel
    measures 61 px of plot area, which is not a chart (VIZ_SPEC section 1.8, the
    measured cost of the A/B #3 winner). Streamlit cannot read the viewport width
    server-side, so the caller decides when to pass it -- the builder only makes
    the layout available.

    `sort="volume"` orders by the share descending; `sort="taxonomy"` orders by
    the family's own hierarchy (domain -> field -> subfield -> topic; ERC domain
    then panel; SDG number). Colours never move with the sort: they follow the
    entity (dataviz non-negotiable "colour follows the entity, never its rank").

    `wrap` (2B-R-13, default `False`): the Find panels never wrap a label onto
    a second line any more -- the left gutter widens to fit the full name on
    ONE row instead (`_tick_display`'s own `wrap` keyword). Pass `wrap=True`
    to get the pre-2B-R-13 two-line-wrap behaviour back; nothing in this app
    does, today.
