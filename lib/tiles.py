"""
app/lib/tiles.py -- the KPI card (BUILD_PLAN_2A.md S9.2 L18, VIZ_SPEC.md
S2.11), copied in from Lorraine Phase 2 `Streamlit/pages/2_(factory)_
Laboratoires.py::_kpi_tile` (lines 1151-1178) and reduced to what BenchUp
needs: name + value + one small line, no per-tile download button.

CARD ANATOMY (2B-R2-6, replacing the 2A/2B-R "value first" stack): the metric
NAME is the FIRST visual element and the largest label on the card, the value
sits in bold under it, and exactly ONE small line closes the card. The gate
read the old order the wrong way round -- a column of big numbers whose names
were set in small grey type under them, which is a scoreboard, not six
measures. The card now answers "what is this?" before "how much?".

The small line is one of two things, never both:
  * the index baseline -- "index median {m} . higher than {pct} of
    institutions" -- for the five measures the index has a median for;
  * a NOTE with one bold figure inside it, which is what the publications card
    carries instead ("({N} in fractional counting)"): full and fractional are
    one measure under two conventions, so the second convention belongs on the
    same card as a companion figure, not on a card of its own and not as a
    second baseline line.
Both render into the SAME `SUBLINE_CLASS` hook, so "every card carries exactly
one small line" stays countable (`html.count(SUBLINE_CLASS) == 1`) whichever
form a card uses.

WHY HTML AND NOT `st.metric`: `st.metric` has no small line, and the small line
is the whole point -- the house rule "every KPI pairs its value with the
denominator or reference it is computed against" (BUILD_PLAN_2A.md L11) is what
it carries. `st.metric`'s delta arrow would also imply a change-over-time
reading that none of these point-in-time measures has (VIZ_SPEC.md S2.11, the
named rejected alternative).

Two house rules this module obeys mechanically:
  * every colour comes from `lib.palette` (`tests/test_palette.py` fails the
    build on a `#RRGGBB` anywhere under `lib/` except `palette.py`);
  * every number inside the rendered markup is composed from a named int
    constant, never typed into the string -- the same discipline
    `lib/charts.py` follows, so this file stays clean if the digit-ban scope
    (`tests/test_narrative.py`) ever widens to it.

The caller passes ALREADY-FORMATTED strings: this module formats no number and
reads no data, so `n/a` (`palette.NA_MARK`) versus a value is the caller's
decision, taken once, in `lib/views_find.py`. The one thing this module does
to a string is SPLIT a note template on its `{n}` slot, so the figure inside a
sentence can be bolded without the sentence itself living here.
