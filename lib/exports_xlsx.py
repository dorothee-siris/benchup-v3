app/lib/exports_xlsx.py -- the ONE workbook the Compare page offers (Sprint 2
Phase 2B, Stream C; BUILD_PLAN_2B.md decision 2B-13, amendment A11).

Pure functions, no Streamlit import and no copy import: the caller owns every
string (sheet titles, the Methods rows) and this module owns only the mechanics
-- sheet-name legality, sheet order, and the bytes. That split is what lets
`lib/copy.py` stay the single source of rendered text while a workbook still
carries the same words the page does.

`openpyxl==3.1.5` (pinned in requirements.txt, installed into envs/env-app) is
reached through pandas' own `ExcelWriter`; nothing here imports it directly, so
a future engine swap is a one-word change.
